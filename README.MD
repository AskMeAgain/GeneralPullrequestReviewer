# General Pullrequest Reviewer

* Intellij Plugin to review/checkout/create a MR request
* Goal is to be compatible with all common git platforms (Gitlab/Github/Bitbucket etc)

## How to add a new Integration (GitHub etc)

0. Checkout node folder for other integrations
1. Add nodes for displaying
   2. Each node needs to implement the marker interfaces
2. Create settings integration panel factory (for getting the connection values)

## Todo

* Better TreeCellRenderer
* Custom Diff Viewer (with references + buttons)
* BitBucket implementation
